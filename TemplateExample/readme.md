This project was originally designed to demonstrate using JetBrains’  custom post templates and has been tasked with the following.

Demonstrate using a class library that provides methods to connect to dbContexts and setuo SeriLog for `ASP.NET Core` projects.

Once done, the project `ConfigurationLibrary` was renamed from `EntityFrameworkHelpers` along with renaming the physical folder to match the new name. ReSharper was used to update the namespaces and references to the new name.
